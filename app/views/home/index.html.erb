<h3>About the site</h3>
<p>This website is base on the Open5e API (https://open5e.com/), which contain data from the
SRD of Dungeon and Dragons fifth edition.</p>
<h3>About the dataset</h3>

and seed the database with JSON file. Then I use Faker to generate 200 DND characters with the data</p>

<p>You can find the Database ERD below:</p>
